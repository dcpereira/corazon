					<h3>Keeping you updated.</h3>
					<p>As the founder of Corazon de Dios, it’s been hard sometime to separate me from the vision.  However, long-term I see Corazon de Dios as being much more than my personal vision; therefore, I want to start now to make some distinctions both financially and personally. </p>
					<p> I am the leader of this vision at this time, so you will certainly see me in most of the activities of the ministry, but in years to come, that may change.  In the future, I will have a “personal Newsletter” to share with you how I am doing personally while the Corazon de Dios Newsletters will share about the ministry. Currently you can find my newsletters on Facebook or receive them y email if you would like like to send me your email address.
					</p>
					<h3>Corazon De Dios is growing.</h3>
					<p>
						It was about a year and a half ago that I felt it was time for me to pioneer a ministry to the Honduran people that reflected my specific calling.   That was when I formed a five person advisory team to help me birth this ministry.  I’m very grateful for those who came along side me to help form this ministry.
					</p>
					<p>   
						Now, we feel like it is time to take the next step and become an official non-profit ministry.   We are in process now of becoming a corporation and are putting together the forms required for the 501c3 status with the US government.   It’s hard to tell for sure how long it will take the government to process it all and give us our non-profit status.  We are praying it will be done by early 2014.
